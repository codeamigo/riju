## Criteria for language inclusion

I aspire for Riju to support more languages than any reasonable person
could conceivably think is reasonable. That said, there are some
requirements:

* **Language must have a clear notion of execution.** This is because
  a core part of Riju is the ability to execute code. Languages like
  [YAML](https://yaml.org/), [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/), and
  Markdown are fine because they have a canonical transformation (into
  [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html),
  [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), and
  [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
  respectively) that can be performed on execution. However, languages
  like JSON, CSS, and HTML are not acceptable, because there's nothing
  reasonable to do when they are run.
* **Language must not require input or configuration.** This is
  because, in order to avoid bloating the interface, Riju provides a
  way to supply code but not any other data. Of course, it's possible
  to supply input interactively, so reading stdin is allowed, but if a
  language can only reasonably be programmed with additional input,
  it's not a candidate for inclusion. Thus, many templating languages
  are excluded, since they don't do anything unless you are
  substituting a value. However, some languages such as
  [Pug](https://pugjs.org/) are allowed, because they implement a
  significant syntax transformation outside of template substitution.
  Also, languages like [Sed](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/) and
  [Awk](https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/) are allowed, because it's
  straightforward to test code written in them even without a
  pre-prepared input file.
* **Language must not require a graphical environment.** This is
  because we use a pty to run code, and there is no X forwarding. As
  such, we can't use languages like
  [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/),
  [Alice](https://www.alice.org/), and
  [Linotte](http://langagelinotte.free.fr/wordpress/).
* **Language must be available for free under a permissive license.**
  This is because we must download and install all languages
  noninteractively in the Docker image build, so anything that
  requires license registration is unlikely to work (or be legal). We
  can't use [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) or
  [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html), for
  example, but we can use [Mathics](https://mathics.github.io/) and
  [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/), which provide
  compatible open-source implementations of the underlying languages.
* **Language must be runnable under Docker on Linux.** This is because
  that's the execution environment we have access to.
  [AppleScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppleScript) is out
  because it only runs on macOS, and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
  is out because it can't be run inside Docker (without the
  `--privileged` flag, which has unacceptable security drawbacks; see
  [#29](https://github.com/radian-software/riju/issues/29)). Note,
  however, that many Windows-based languages can be used successfully
  via [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/) or
  [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/), such as
  [Cmd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cmd.exe),
  [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)),
  and [Visual Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic).

Here are some explicit *non-requirements*:

* *Language must be well-known.* Nope, I'll be happy to add your pet
  project; after all,
  [Kalyn](https://github.com/radian-software/kalyn) and
  [Ink](https://github.com/thesephist/ink) are already supported.
* *Language must be useful.* I have no objection to adding everything
  on the esolangs wiki, if there are interpreters/compilers available.
* *Language must be easy to install and run.* Well, it would be nice,
  but I've seen some s\*\*\* when adding languages to Riju so it will
  take a lot to surprise me at this point.
