# Reporting a security issue

Please contact me at
[security+riju@radian.codes](mailto:security+riju@radian.codes) if you
find any way to:

* Take down Riju without using a large number of concurrent sessions.
* View or interfere with another user's session.
* Tamper with the Riju server.

Although I work on Riju in my free time, I take security seriously, so
I will do my best to get back to you in less than a week, and to
correct the vulnerability as soon as possible (I will let you know the
likely timeline by email).
